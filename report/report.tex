\section{Introduction} 
This is a proposal to carry out a project to develop a method for diagnosing
cardiac arrhythmias by applying signal processing techniques to ECG
measurements.  There is a need to be able to quickly diagnose arrhythmias so
that treatment can be administered expediently.  Such a method could be used in
AED devices, pacemakers, ECG machines, and other diagnostic equipment.  This
would allow quicker diagnosis and therefore treatment of cardiac arrhythmias
which may extend patient lives.

\section{Implementation}
The ease of distinguishing an arrhythmia with DSP depends on the particular
arrhythmia.  During research, an arrhythmia will be chosen that should be
possible to distinguish using elementary signal processing techniques including
IIR filtering, adaptive filtering, wavelet transforms, and frequency-domain
analysis.
